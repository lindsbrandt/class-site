<p> Concept: Inspired by "My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge" by Laurel
  Schwulst. Based of the idea that a website is a puddle, I created a concept for a site that
  changes function based off the weather. If it is raining in your area, the website "rains" and
  reveals a submission bar that a viewer can enter text to submit to the site. When it is sunny, the mouse
  acts as a light beam that reveals the text on the page in the radius of the mouse. In any other weather,
  the website remains empty.</p>
